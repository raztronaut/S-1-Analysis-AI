Our Mission
Snowflake’s mission is to enable every organization to be data-driven.

Overview
We pioneered the Data Cloud, an ecosystem where thousands of organizations have seamless access to explore, share, and unlock the value of their data. Our cloud-native platform enables customers to consolidate data into a single source of truth to drive meaningful business insights, build data-driven applications, and share data.

For the fiscal years ended January 31, 2019 and 2020, our revenue was $96.7 million and $264.7 million, respectively, representing 174% year-over-year growth. For the six months ended July 31, 2019 and 2020, our revenue was $104.0 million and $242.0 million, respectively, representing 133% year-over-year growth. Our net loss was $178.0 million and $348.5 million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively. Our net loss for the six months ended July 31, 2019 and 2020 was $171.3 million and $177.2 million, respectively. Our operating expenses were $110.5 million and $300.2 million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively.

Risk Factors
An investment in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as the other information in this prospectus, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” before deciding whether to invest in our Class A common stock.
- We have a history of net losses, we anticipate increasing our operating expenses in the future, and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability.
- Our rapid growth may not be indicative of our future growth, and we have a limited operating history under our current consumption-based business model, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful.
- The COVID-19 pandemic could adversely impact our business, operating results, and financial condition.
- Our business depends on our ability to retain and expand our customer relationships. For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, our revenue retention rate was 158%.

Use of Proceeds
We estimate that the net proceeds from the sale of the Class A common stock that we are offering will be approximately $X.X billion. The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our capitalization and financial flexibility and create a public market for our Class A common stock. We intend to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering for general corporate purposes, including working capital, operating expenses, and capital expenditures.
